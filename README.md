# Introduction-to-Windows-Based-Application

# Chapter 09
Create a Windows application that can be used to input a user’s name. Include an appropriate label indicator for the name and a textbox for the input entry.
A button labeled OK should retrieve and display the value entered on another label positioned near the bottom of the form. The font color for all objects should be yellow.
Change the background color of the form to an appropriate one to use with your yellow text. Change the Font property to a font of your choice.
The size of the font for all objects except the Button should be at least 14 points. The Button fond should be 16 points.
Add a title caption of “Name Retrieval App” to the form. Initially clear the text from the label that will display your final answer.
When the ok button is pressed, retrieve the name and concatenate that value with a Congratulatory message.
For example, you might display “Congratulations, Brenda Lewis, you retrieved the data!” Align the controls so they are aesthetically pleasing.
Be sure to change to default names of all controls involved in program statements
